Slick, intuitive, interface (lots of jQuery!)
Built for business sites
True cloud/cluster CMS with no single point of failure. Any server can be turned off or replaced without any downtime for any websites.
Distributed data (multiple servers, multiple data centres)
Simple but flexible template system. Designer only needs to know HTML to create a template. Simple %%fields%% used for content, menus etc.
No WYSIWYG editor. A content layer template system is used in its place  
3 different interfaces (content editor, designer, SEO provider)
Modules Apps like FB
